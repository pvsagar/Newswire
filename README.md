4. significant time was spent on plots to get the desired labels in appropriate locations.

Future Scope:
There is a lot of scope for analysis from the obtained data. Though there are several plots available, Bar plots are best for understanding basic demographics. provided significant time, In-depth analysis can be carried out which could include 
1. Sentiment analysis depending on variables (location specific, day specific, based on categories and tags mentioned). 
2. Clustering locations and creating zones to carryout analysis.
3. Categories and tags can also be clustered based on type and can be used for better understanding of business.
